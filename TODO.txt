- Implement merge points on mouse down when drawing new line.
- Move crossing detection code to AreasData.
- Make new areas structure that supports holes (missing segments)

- Implement unclosed area support (hit testing, updates)
- Implement areas update on point moves

- Investigate OpenLayers library for rendering and event handling.
  Would also be nice because they have support for rendering existing stuff.
