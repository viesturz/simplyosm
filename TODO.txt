- Implement merge points on mouse down when drawing new line.
- Move crossing detection code to AreasData.
- Make new areas structure that supports holes (missing segments)
- Implement areas update

- Investigate OpenLayers library for rendering and event handling.
  Would also be nice because they have support for rendering existing stuff.
